# Branching
We follow a version to the Github flow.  

## Default branch
`master` is our default branch and will always be what features, bugfixes, etc are brought into.  

## Feature branches
All new feature branches that reside within the repository will be prefixed with `feature/<short-name>`

## Bugfix branches
All new bugfix branches that reside within the repository will be prefixed with `bugfixes/<short-name>`

## Access to the git repository
Code owners and Maintainers will be the only ones who will be guaranteed access to the github repo to make code changes.  Some contributors will also be temporarily granted access on a case by case basis.
